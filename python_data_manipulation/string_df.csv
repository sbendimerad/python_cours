description
"Scents of smoke and aged honey entice on the nose of this bone-dry Riesling from Peconic Bay. Lean in profile with a sharp, steely minerality, it finishes pleasantly on a tart, sour lemon candy note."
"This bottling, which is Randall Grahm's hommage to the Northern Rhône, has varied over the vintages, but with this 2006, hits the mark as never before. Made with a splash of Grenache, it's full-bodied, bone dry and compelling in the intricacy of flavors. The blackberries, black cherries, licorice, and raspberries have elements of roasted meats and wild mushrooms sautéed in butter, tamari and a few drops of balsamic, liberally dusted with black pepper. Unique and compelling, and should develop over the next six years."
"For an easy and aromatic Sauvignon, Ermacora delivers very good structure and harmony in the mouth. The wine is fresh and lively with aromas of passion fruit, papaya and mango and it leaves a soft and pleasurable sensation."
"A 65-35 blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is bold, opulent and elaborate. This expression has perfumed notes of incense and exotic spice, lavished over tones of ripe cherry and blackberry."
"Like all of Beringer's 2001 gold letter single-vineyard Cabs, this one is a cellar laydown. It's hard in tannins now, a dry wine that leaves the palate rasping because it's so astringent. Yet the fruit is gigantically ripe, flooding the mouth with blackberries and cherries that are the essence of those fruits. With all that ripeness, the acidity is crisp and fine. Drink 2008–2020."
"Powerful and dense, the spicy fruit is solid, dark and juicy. There is a fine balance here, the rich fruit powering through the wood tannins to give an impressive, concentrated finish."
"This Rosé of Sangiovese is light in color and density, with fruit flavors of watermelon and a hint of peach. It's a fine, light and easy sipper."
"Nothing more than cherry soda aromas to get it going. It's highly confected, with decent acidity its only saving grace."
This Barbera from the Monferrato area offers more evolved notes of spice and nut along with bright fruit and berry tones. The wine is tonic and tight in the mouth but those berry nuances and bright acidity make it a perfect match to cheese-filled ravioli.
"This lush, mouth-warming Syrah offers a wealth of currant, plum, chocolate, plum, raisin and peppery spice flavors that flood the mouth, framed in thick but refined tannins. It's bone dry, and the oak seems just right. It's soft and high in alcohol, in the manner of Paso Robles reds."
"Well oaked. You pick up on the charry smoke and vanilla right away. But then the fruit hits, all ripe figs and sweet green grasses and lemons and limes and even hints of pineapple. With the fresh acidity, it all combines to a big, lush wine, with a clean, food-friendly scour."
"Soft and stewy up front, without a whole lot of vigor. It feels wide and hard, with abrasive tannins and strained flavors of herbal berry and leather. On the finish it's earthy, tannic and warm, with a weedy note along with barrel spice."
"Jammy and simple, with blackberry, blueberry and pepper flavors. Finishes dry, with a scour of tannins."
"Tropical and toasty, with buttercup and banana on the nose. Good acidity keeps the palate zesty and moving forward, while the flavors of lemon, lime and pineapple are juicy and clean. Good in a fresh and simple way, with just a spot of oak character."
"Made in an exceptionally ripe and strongly oaky way, this wine is rather heavy right now. The Cabernet was blended with some Syrah and Petit Verdot grown in a Calistoga vineyard. There's no questioning the richness, but it's so ripe that the blackberries veer into dark chocolate and prunes. See what it does over the next eight years."
"Sandalwood, hibiscus and grapeseed aromas converge on the nose of this wine that comes from a vineyard just west of the Sta. Rita Hills. The palate shows barely ripe raspberry fruit, a touch of grassiness and a spicing of anise seed, proving quite light and vibrant even at four years old."
"Comprised of Zinfandel, Carignan, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this is a rustically structured wine whose best features are dryness and fruitiness. Easy and charming for everyday foods."
"This is classic Washington Merlot, with flesh and a full-bodied middle. It offers a generous palate of cherries and berries, trailing into light tannins with a streak of green tea and coffee. The wine is balanced and bright, with lightly lifted aromas and a solid midpalate."
"A little coarse in the mouth, with grippy tannins, but it sure is ripe, offering a wealth of cherry, raspberry, sweet oak and spice flavors. It's soft enough to drink now."
"Very dry and raisiny-pruney, a harsh, somewhat bitter wine. The dryness is relieved by some ripely sweet blackberries that show up in the middle palate."
Madonna del Piano Riserva's rich elements of barbecue smoke and spice add background nuances to black fruit and mature cherry. But what really sets this Brunello apart is the smoothness of its silky texture.
"Possesses some decent black-cherry aromas and flavors with leathery, earthy accents, but also a sour streak and a sulfurous note that refused to yield. The wine finishes dry, with some of the astringency shown by many 1998s."
"This Barolo from the Cannubi vineyard opens with a delicate aromatic embroidery of vanilla, forest berry, cola, spice and licorice. The texture here is tight, fine and very silky and those characteristic Nebbiolo flavors last a long time on the finish. You could save this wine five to 10 more years and pair it with slow-cooked duck confit."
"This Chardonnay is one of the family-owned winery's workhorse bottlings, and it pulls its weight with finesse, showing light aromas of Pink Lady apple, grapefruit peel and almond on the nose. Lemon-lime acidity frames each sip, while grapefruit flavors meld with lemongrass and kaffir lime, finishing on riper stone fruit notes."
"Cesari's lush Amarone is particularly good this vintage. This is a standout wine that is distinguished by a pretty mineral note of graphite or flint that frames the fruit in an extremely elegant manner. The effect is quite extraordinary and this dense wine delivers a long, drying finish."
"Ripe in cherry and chocolate fruit, with a slightly rustic mouthfeel of edgy tannins and an earthy, mushroomy quality, this Merlot has enough fanciness to accompany a nice leg of lamb or roast pork."
"This is a tasty white for patio sipping and summer picnics. Fresh, lively aromas are softened with a lovely floral edge, followed by easy-going, refreshing flavors of lemon, nectarine and sea salt. It's a flirty wine that should pair well with fruit, fresh fish and salads."
"In the heat of the 2008 vintage, it may have been a mistake to further dry 20% of the grapes for this wine. The result has turned out chocolaty-ripe, but also with a touch of raisining evident, and while there's volume, there's also a certain lack of midpalate richness."
"The “oak” in the name is appropriate because this one is draped in unctuous, heavy, burnt aromas. The nose is a cloud of coconut, char and woody blackberry, while the syrupy palate is all sweet black plum, carob, mint and resin. Quite oaky and thick for a value-priced wine."
"A blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc, this is a forward, fruity, almost sweet-tasting wine, considerably fruitier and less compelling than the previous vintage. Broad and accessible, with a pretty milk-chocolate finish, it's an easy sipper to enjoy while it's still in the bloom of youth."
"Apart from making its own branded wines, the go-ahead Buzet cooperative sells a number of wines from privately-owned estates. This wine is firmly in the tradition of Bordeaux blends, with its dry tannins and firm, licorice and bitter chocolate flavors. It would be worth aging for 2 more years."
"Attractive, fruity wine, with good tannins as well as stalky black currant fruit flavors. Its ripeness is a sign of the warm vintage."
"Lovely, dense aromas of dried flowers, herbs, cherries and chocolate immediately capture attention. This is a superbly elegant wine, with both precision and power. Orange-peel flavors highlight deep cherry compote, with tension, balance and length in abundance."
"Some initial rubbery notes blow off to reveal pear and citrus fruit. This is an off-dry wine, balanced by really crisp acids that seem a little metallic on the finish."
"Essentially this is a rosé of Merlot, with just 5% Muscat blended in. Strawberry and watermelon fruit is light and lively, with an undercurrent of orange juice, perhaps from that Muscat. Merlot-based rosés tend to fall a bit on the tannic side, which here adds grip to the finish."
"Layers of spicy wood add to the smooth, creamy character of this wine. It has vivid acidity lifted by green fruit skins and flavors of pineapple and grapefruit. There is a final perfume from the Muscadelle in the blend."
"You'll want to stash this fresh, young Syrah away for a couple years. It's pretty tannic now, locking down the palate. But what fruit! Enormous in blackberries, currants and cola, with an undertow of bitter chocolate, pepper and black olive tapenade. Give it until 2009, if you can."
"Vanilla and pear aromas are neither exciting nor a turn-off, while the palate is solid, ifa bit tangy and weighty. Overall this is a modest wine that's on the downturn. It's not bad but it is flat-edged and bulky. Imported by Palm Bay Imports."
"Crisp, clean and fruity, this has attractive acidity and lively fruit. It's bright and citrus flavored, with an aromatic finish."
"Though not planted until 2001, the east-facing Lone Oak Vineyard is adjacent to the legendary vines of Garys' and Rosella's. The nose conveys lemon-lime soda and white rock minerality, and flavors combine baked apple, yeasty bread and lime. Bright acidity exhilarates the tongue, making a perfect partner for a lunch of shellfish, halibut or chicken salad."
"Comes across as slightly light on fruit and herbal, but delivers a plump mouthfeel. In the end, there's enough cherry fruit to give it a charming personality."
"All Pinot Noir, fermented in neutral oak and put through partial malolactic, this belongs in the rosé category. A pretty, pale-copper color, it offers a pleasing toasted-cracker frame around stone fruit and supple acids. Drink this chilled to white wine temperature."
"This young wine needs time in a decanter or vigorous swirling in the glass to dissipate some residual sulfur aromas, but it comes around to reveal lean black-cherry fruit accented by slightly bitter wood. It's better than it sounds and would make for a decent bar pour or airline offering."
"A smooth, full-bodied wine that really showcases what Washington Merlot is all about. Plummy and sweet, the fleshy fruit hints at raspberry preserves, leading to a silky, chocolate and vanilla finish."
"As fresh as they come, with bright strawberry flavors touched by caramel and red currant acidity. For drinking this summer."
"For Spanish Chardonnay, this is perfectly good and clean. The nose brings your basic set of white-fruit, mineral and fresh herb flavors, while the palate is lively despite some dry, resiny oak flavor. Even with banana, vanilla and creamy flavors, the wine is decidedly not cloying."
"From the beginning you can tell that this Bordeaux-style blend has the requisite components to make the grade. The bouquet offers baking spices, berry and vanilla in large doses, while the palate is ample, fresh and fairly racy. Nothing dull or clumsy here; it's a balanced, structured wine with aging ability. Drink now or hold through 2009. Imported by Kysela Père et Fils."
"Red in color, with sweet aromas of sugar beet, Red Delicious apple and cherry. It feels zesty, with simple flavors of red fruit and red apple. The finish is dry and a touch peppery. Drink immediately while it's fresh."
"Green aromas of bell pepper, cracked peppercorn and leafy spinach give the Cabernet component away but are rendered manageable and less pronounced thanks to the wine's softer Merlot side. The wine has good length with dusty tannins and loads of Mediterranean spice on the close."
"A simple wine. The underlying Zin is rather thin and jammy, while a clumsy overlay of oak adds unnatural vanilla and woodsap flavors."
"From what used to be known as the Premières Côtes de Bordeaux, this Merlot-dominated wine offers soft fruits laced with acidity and gentle tannins. It is not a wine for aging."
"Despite starting out a bit mute, what lurks below is nothing short of stellar. Fine black licorice and ripe, meaty fruit creates a dark, manly flavor profile, while the finish deals a layer cake's worth of fudge, vanilla and espresso. Virtually anything you would want in a Brunello is here. Imported by Lauber Imports."
"This big, smoky wine has great richness and a big, concentrated structure. The feel is dark, solid, based on spice, new wood and ripe black plums touched with red berries, the tannins sheltering beneath."
"A beautiful, young and firmly tannic Pinot Noir that should improve in the bottle. It's fully dry and fine in acidity, with expressive flavors of black and red cherries, cola, beef jerky, crushed pepper and sweet, smoky sandalwood. Very nice now with a good steak, and ought to show development over the next 5–7 years."
"A young, tart, somewhat candied Thea's brings a mouthful of primary berry fruit flavor to bear, principally raspberries and cherries. It shows generous acidity, keeping the palate lively, and hints of light herb, though little new oak influence."
"The nose has the vintage's heavy quality, yet the palate runs toward acidic, with an emphasis on red cherry and raspberry. The more it opens, and the more the wine's tannins and acids do their thing, the tougher it gets. Food seems like a must."
Soft and flat in texture with a toffee character and a touch of spice. It tastes old before its time.
"Deeply flavored, this impressive Syrah advances the red wine cause in Temecula. It's a big, powerful wine, rich in blackberry, currant and new oak flavors, with a peppery, chocolate, anise and grilled meat finish. Really fine now, but also packed with young, astringent tannins, it's a wine to decant, or cellar for up to five years."
"The union of Pinotage, Cabernet, Shiraz and Merlot showcases the best of each grape, offering blackberry, spice and mocha on the nose and flavors of ripe red fruit, pepper and cedar on the palate. Pinotage makes a soft and subtle show here, adding fruity heft without the angles. An elegant wine with a lot of personality."
"A heady and lifted nose suggests healing herbs steeped in honey. The palate is rich and unctuous but fresh with the lemon peel, herb and clear honey notes that were already present on the nose. The balance between luscious and tart is on a knife's edge and all the more thrilling for it. The flavors last and last—not in sweetness but in utter, gloried freshness. Drink 2016–2040."
"This bargain-priced offering combines tobacco leaf with Green Gage plum in a medium-bodied format. The flavors aren't quite as fresh and vibrant as the best examples, but it'll more than do for many occasions."
"An appealing blend of 55% Grenache, 33% Shiraz and 12% Mourvèdre, this offering from Hewitson boasts upfront scents of cherries, caramel and vanilla, then adds a hint of dark coffee or tree bark on the palate. The creamy texture and the lush fruit make this  easy to drink now and over the next few years."
"This wine runs the gamut of crisp, mineral flavors. It is tight, driven by green flavors and acidity, with just a touch of vanilla. As befits a Petit Chablis, there is lightness rather than weight, but it makes a delicious aperitif style of wine."
"In accordance to what 2003 dealt out, this wine is a bit stewy and broad. It shows cola, tree bark and baked fruit on the nose, and then sweet plum and chocolate on the finish. It's not a wine for deep contemplation; drink now to enjoy its robust plumpness."
"Ripe, brambly notes accentuate luscious blackberry and cassis flavors in this fleshy, full-bodied red blend. It's a straightforward wine with baby-soft tannins underlining its forward, fruity style."
"Le Coste Mosconi delivers a very attractive ensemble of ripe fruit aromas with oak-driven shadings of vanilla, cinnamon and clove. No single aroma is over the top and the wine is indeed nicely integrated and balanced. The tannins are drying and tight, creating a firm impression on the close."
"Year in and year out, Mer Soleil's Chardonnay is one of the biggest, most distinctive ones in California. The '06 is almost like a late-harvest dessert wine, rich in apricot jam, pineapple custard and new oak butterscotch flavors, but for all the opulence, it's entirely dry, and has zesty Monterey acidity. Almost a food group in itself, it will challenge chefs to rise to the occasion."
"As with many of the wines of Sandrone, it is easy to be beguiled by the fruit, and miss the underlying structure holding it together. This is true of the Dolcetto, where the wine initially shows plenty of dark fruit and a touch of mint, but gains a spicy complexity as it takes in air. The wine will benefit from a couple of years in the bottle, but is delicious now."
"This cheerful Rosso di Montalcino offers a distinctively oak-driven bouquet of smoke, spice and mesquite followed by a bright ensemble of berry fruit aromas. The wine is soft and slightly sweet on the finish with a burst of cherry and blueberry at the close."
"A smooth, cream–textured wine, just given an edge by a spice and yeast character. The wine offers layers of acidity, white fruits, crisp apples rounded out by its richness. For aging over 4–5 years, probably more."
"There's a touch of red apple skin or apple sauce at the start that is followed by slightly awkward notes of bubblegum and cotton candy. This is a strange Negroamaro-based rosé with aromas of chopped mint or herbs at the back. The mouthfeel is bright, tonic and firm."
"An attractive and balanced rosé made from a diverse blend of 50% Syrah, 15% Grenache, 10% Cabernet Franc, 10% Mourvèdre, 10% Cinsault and 5% Carignan. There's great lift to the yellow peach, white cherry and wild strawberry fruit flavors, with the creamy mouth closing on a soft white pepper note. Drink now."
"Made from Pinot Noir, this is a dry, crisp young blush wine of some real interest and complexity. It has flavors of unsweetened orange pekoe tea, tangerine zest and vanilla, with a scour of dusty tannins."
"This is a brambly, blueberry-laden Petite Sirah, with black cherry, plum and chocolate highlights. Firm, ripe tannins bring a streak of lemon verbena. It's gently earthy, absolutely flavorful and drinking beautifully."
"Rusciano is a blend of Syrah and Nero d'Avola that displays impressive depth and complexity. Aromas of dark fruit, spice, black currant and earthy tobacco build in intensity as the wine evolves in the glass. The finish is smooth and rich."
"Sweaty leather, stewed berry, green herb and earth aromas set up a fresh, tomato-like and raw palate. On the flavor profile, this deals equal parts earth, dry spice, green peppercorn and red-fruit notes. A simple finish is adequately dry and spicy."
"Early aromas of wintergreen, pepper and autumn leaves are joined by plum and cherry sweetness on the palate. The wine opens fairly quickly into a bright, juicy, lively package that offers grabby tannins, a touch of coarseness and zest. Should drink well for the next four or five years."
"Very different from the Bricco delle Viole cru expression from the same producer, this wine offers bold, ripe fruit with lingering tones of red cherry, leather, charcoal and campfire. The fruit is thick and succulent and the finish offers sweet, succulent spice flavors. Multiple U.S. importers."
"Fat and full, with simple clean fruit, strawberry juice and orange zest. Soft aftertaste."
"This elegant Brunello opens to a lean, streamlined style. The garnet color is true to the Sangiovese variety and so are the wine's aromas of forest berry, earth and pressed flower. You'll like the bright, soft close, with its tiny touch of fruity sweetness."
"The problem with this special cuvée from Mongravey is wood. There is too much of it, and it completely dominates the high-extract fruit. There is toast, oak and more toast. The fruit seems too light to cope."
"This is likeable for its dryness and the burst of lemony acidity that makes it so invitingly crisp. The flavors are subtle and rich, suggesting Meyer lemon, white peach and a lick of vanilla bean."
"Blackberry, licorice and leather on the nose lead to a tannic, firm palate with stretched dark plum and black cherry flavors. There's vibrancy and juiciness to the wine, with a firm finish that introduces chocolate. Highly regular, with nothing glaring or wrong."
"With just over 200 cases made, Maronea is a precious blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Petit Verdot that opens with huge concentration and plush aromas of ripe cherry, blackberry and chocolate. The tannins are firm and determined: The finish is accented by sweet fruit."
"Earthy and chocolaty at first, but with air it reveals a more candied, coco-puff set of aromas and flavors. There's sweetnees, sharp acidity, marshmallow notes and snap. Not much in the way of excitement or high quality here; it tastes candied but also a little sour."
"Aims at a northern Rhône style and succeeds, with modest oak levels and some smoky, meaty nuances. The boysenberry and blackberry fruit flavors are juicy and tart, leading into a dusty finish."
"The nose on this wine impresses from the start, with its clean aromas of apples, spice and citrus. On the palate, an attractive balance of minerality and refreshing fruit triumphs. Not terribly complex, but fun and exciting."
"This white blend offers bright aromas and flavors of grapefruit, pear and green apple. There's also an interesting floral note here as well which balances the leaner fruits. The wine finishes crisp with a minerally lime spin. Pair with raw oysters, grilled fish or chicken."
"Winemaker Bob Bertheau lays back on the new oak and gives this great vineyard its due. A classic spine of juicy acid, with ripe—but not fat—citrus and apricot flavors. Long, balanced and tightly focused."
"As its brawny name suggests, Roccato (Sangiovese and Cabernet) is a thickly concentrated wine with powerful blasts of plum, dried herbs, mint candy, licorice and white talc powder. It's ripe and ready to drink now."
"Older vines from the named vineyard provide the fruit for this 100% Sangiovese, barrique-aged Super Tuscan. The cherry, tart-berry and chocolate aromas pick up vibrant licorice accents as they blossom into full flavors on the palate. The already svelte mouthfeel should only improve, as the still substantial, firm tannins on the cocoa-tinged finish resolve. Hold for three years; drink 2004–2010."
"Here's a youthful Brunello with thick layers of blueberry fruit and sweet flavors of raw cookie dough. The wine is dark and impenetrable in appearance and offers a plush, chewy texture."
"Totally creamy notions of rose and carnation create a seductive nose. The palate joins in with ample fruit and sweetness. The residual sugar is finely balanced with lemony freshness: a very traditional, if not to say old-fashioned Gewürztraminer, but totally charming and rather delicious. Finishes medium sweet."
"This is a crisp, fresh and fruity rosé, made from Touriga Nacional in the same region where Vinho Verde is produced. It's vivid acidity is bright, with raspberry flavors and low alcohol."
"Smooth and sophisticated with rich blackberry and plum aromas backed by oak-driven tones of spice and leather, this is a very rich expression of Barbera (that sees eight months in oak barrels). The overall effect is excellent and the mouthfeel culminates with bright tones of prune and crushed black pepper."
"A very nice wine, lush and drinkable, that demonstrates not only the pedigree of its vineyards (Stolpman and Thompson), but also the deft approach of the winemaker. Soft and juicy, it offers layers of crushed cherry, cassis, red currant, licorice, beef jerky and black pepper flavors, wrapped into rich, fine tannins. Drink now through 2010."
"Leather, smashed berries and juniper reveal the age of this wine, further enhanced with a meaty mouthfeel, redolent with flavors of blueberry and purple fruits. Charred vanilla touches on the finish."
"A simple wine that straddles the balance between grassy, citrusy flavors and riper, more melony ones. It's crisp and dry and offers pleasure without a great deal of complexity, although there are some oaky, leesy notes. From Santa Ynez and Santa Maria valleys."
"One of Australia's most expensive and sought-after Cabernet blends, Mount Mary's Quintet has failed to impress more than one American critic. It's an appealing, well-crafted wine that combines leather, cherry and dried herbs in a somewhat lean, crisp style that delivers a long, mineral-and-cedar finish."
"Thick and luscious with deep oak tones and big cherry fruit flavors, this southern Italian red is a real fruit bomb with plush cherry intensity and ripe berry flavors. The strong sunshine has done its part to shape a thick, succulent red wine."
