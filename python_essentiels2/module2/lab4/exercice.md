# Scenario
Do you know what a palindrome is?

It's a word which look the same when read forward and backward. For example, "kayak" is a palindrome, while "loyal" is not.

Your task is to write a program which:

asks the user for some text;
checks whether the entered text is a palindrome, and prints result.
* Note:

* assume that an empty string isn't a palindrome;
* treat upper- and lower-case letters as equal;
* spaces are not taken into account during the check - treat them as non-existent;
* there are more than a few correct solutions - try to find more than one.
