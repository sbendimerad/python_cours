* use the print() function to print the line Hello, Python! to the screen. Use double quotes around the string;

* having done that, use the print() function again, but this time print your first name;

* remove the double quotes and run your code. Watch Python's reaction. What kind of error is thrown?

* then, remove the parentheses, put back the double quotes, and run your code again. What kind of error is thrown this time?

* experiment as much as you can. Change double quotes to single quotes, use multiple print() functions on the same line, and then on different lines. See what happens.
